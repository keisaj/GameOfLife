## General Information
- The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.
- Coded in Python using Pygame library
- Original code provided by DevDungeon
- My addition includes more controls and ability to draw desired shapes with mouse.
- Purpose of this project was to extend existing Game of Life project by DevDungeon by adding more features.
- I did it as personal project to increase my skills in Pygame


## Technologies Used
- Python - version 3.8
- Pygame - version 2.1.2


## Controls
s -> pause/unpause the game

r -> restare with random population

q -> quit

c -> clear population

mouse left button -> draw cells

## Setup
Requirements for this project are listed in requirements.txt file.

Run gameoflife.py to start the game


## Project Status
Project is:  _complete_.
